# ASL16
Advanced Systems Lab project, Fall 2016

This repository contains the code, data (obtained by running the system in Microsoft Azure in several different settings), and theoretical system modelling (with queuing theory) developed during the Advanced Systems Lab course in the Computer Science MSc at ETH Zurich. My final grade for this course was 6.00/6.00.

Each of the "ljoao-milestone(1/2/3)" files corresponds to a report on a different aspect of the system. A detailed description of the system can be found in "ljoao-milestone1". The data from the several experiments was analyzed in "ljoao-milestone2". Finally, the system was modelled theoretically by a composition of queues, and analyzed using techniques and results from queuing theory in "ljoao-milestone3". More rigorous data analysis can also be found in this report.

The code can be found in the "Project_ASL" folder, appropriately commented.
